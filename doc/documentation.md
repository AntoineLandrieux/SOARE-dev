## Interpreter

### Installing SOARE

To install SOARE, you can download the source code or the release from the [official repo](https://github.com/AntoineLandrieux/SOARE/).

**With git** :

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AntoineLandrieux/SOARE.git
```

On Windows, after [compiling the interpreter](#compiling-the-interpreter), you can run the `install.bat` file.

To launch SOARE:

```sh
# Linux
bin/soare
# Windows
%SOARE%\soare.exe
```

### Compiling the Interpreter

**Dependencies** :

- `ar`
- `g++`
- `gcc`
- `make`
- `windres` (for Windows only)

```sh
make
```

### Interpreter Commands

- `?run`

Executes the code written in the console

```txt
>>> write "Hello!"
>>> ?run
Hello!
>>> ?run
Hello!
```

- `?commit`

Executes the code written in the console once

```txt
>>> write "Hello!";
>>> ?commit
Hello!
>>> ?commit
>>>
```

- `?clear`

Clears the console content

```txt
>>>
```

- `?exit`

Closes the interpreter

```txt
>>>?exit

Bye!

```

### Loading a File

To load a file, you can use the command:

```sh
soare "filename.soare"
```

## SOARE

### Introduction

Many examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in SOARE begin with the character ?, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment can appear at the start of a line or after whitespace or code, but not inside a string literal. Since comments are intended to clarify the code and are not interpreted by SOARE, they can be omitted when typing in examples.

**Some examples** :

```txt
? this is the first comment
$number = 1; ? and this is the second comment
             ? ... and now a third !
$text = "? This is not a comment because it's inside quotes.";
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use ; at the end of a statement to indicate that it is complete.

### Text and Numbers

SOARE can manipulate text (represented by a string) as well as numbers. This includes characters like "!", words like "rabbit", names like "Paris", sentences like "I support you.", etc. "Yay!". They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result.

To display text, we use the write keyword:

```txt
write "Hello World!";
write 123.456;
```

### Storing Data

A variable allows you to store a number or text. A variable is defined by a name and a value.

```txt
? $ to create a new variable
$name = "Antoine"
$age = 15

? here the variable age already exists, so no need for the $ sign
age = age + 1

? the + sign with strings allows you to concatenate them
write "Hello " + name + " " + age + "yo";
```

### Defining Functions

We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series:

```txt
@fib(n)
  ? Print a Fibonacci series up to n.
  $a = 0;
  $b = 1;
  $next = b;
  
  while a < n do
    write a;
    a = b;
    b = next;
    next = a + b;
  end;
  
  return a;
end;

write "The last value is " + fib(100);
```

The `@` keyword introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the list of formal parameters in parentheses and separated by a ;.

The `return` keyword exits the function, returning a value to the place where the function was called.

### Loops and Conditional Structures

**while** :

The while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10) remains true. In SOARE, as in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The test used in the example is a simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same way as in C: < (less than), > (greater than), == (equal to), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to), and != (not equal to).

```txt
? Fibonacci series:
? the sum of two elements defines the next
$a = 0;
$b = 1;
$next = b;

while a < 100 do
  write a + " ";
  a = b;
  b = next;
  next = a + b;
end;
```

**if** et **iferror** :

The most well-known type of statement is perhaps the if statement. For example:

```txt

? Include standard functions
try
  loadimport "script_path/std.soare";

  write "Enter a digit:";
  $x = 0;
  inputch x;

  if NaN(x) do
    write "Not a number"
  or x < 0 do
    write "Negative";
  or x == 0 do
    write "Zero";
  else
    write "Positive";
  end;

iferror
  write "std.soare not found!"
end;
```

### Arrays

Strings or numbers are actually arrays of characters:

```txt
$message = "Hello";
$index = 0;

while index > 0 do
  try
    write message[index];
  iferror
    index = 0-1;
  end;
end;
```

### User Inputs

You can capture user input using `inputch`

```txt
$input="";

inputch input;
write "The " + input + " key has been pressed";
```
